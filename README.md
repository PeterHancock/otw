Wargames, in alphabetical order

## bandit - 24/24
Relies on having some basic understanding of Linux commands. A gentle introduction to wargames, with some cool tricks.

## krypton - 4/6
Crypto-based challenge. Currently stuck on krypton 5 (polyalphabetic, non-Vigenere).

## leviathan - 7/7
Reverse-engineering. Get ready to whip out gdb!

## natas - 11/?
Web-based - still in progress.

## semtex - 3/?
I needed something to do whilst stuck on krypton.

## vortex - 2/?
Seems to be mainly based of buffer overflows. Got stuck pretty early on unfortunately...
